## Overview
The goal of this project was to manage and analyze sales data to identify trends, optimize performance, and support data-driven decisions.

## Data Management Process
In Power BI, I performed the following tasks for data management:
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates and filtered out incomplete records.
- **Data Transformation**: Standardized formats, created calculated columns, and normalized values.
- **Data Modeling**: Established relationships between tables to enhance data connectivity and analysis.

## Insights and Visualizations
The following visuals were created in the images  to derive insights:
- **Sales Over Time**: Shows sales trends month by month.
- **Product Performance**: Highlights top-performing products.
- **Regional Analysis**: Compares sales across different regions.


## Results and Learnings
- Identified peak sales months and top-selling products.
- Regional analysis helped pinpoint areas for targeted marketing.
- Learned how to optimize data flows and manage large datasets in Power BI.

## How to Replicate
1. **Data**: Use a sample dataset (or describe how to get similar data).
2. **Transformation**: Follow the steps outlined above in Power BI.
